Initial data review failed due to noise (could not calculate AR target due to too many outliers.)

Review by pouch tested indicates that specific pouches had a pattern of very low dry intensties with respect to the rest of the loop.  There is no obvious pattern by crossweb or foil set.

The runs/pouches that this correspond to are:
4147114_NA_H22_15_BLUE.csv
4147114_NA_H44_1_BLUE.csv
4147114_NA_H44_8_BLUE.csv
4147114_NA_H44_9_BLUE.csv
4147114_NA_H44_10_BLUE.csv
4147114_NA_H44_15_BLUE.csv

The very low dry intensities, with no dramatic change in wet intensity is indicative of an issue with exposure.  There were no notes from the operator during testing to indicate that slides remained exposed to ambient air for any extended period of time. 

As such, this is believed to be due to a problem with pouching or desiccant.  Need to follow up with production to see if there were any issued during pouching of the slides from this punch.

Since the pattern of this failure is not consistent with a problem with the loop itself, data from these runs should be excluded and loop qual reprocessed to evaluate loop acceptability.
